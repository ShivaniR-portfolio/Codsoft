 Codsoft Data Science Projects
 
This repository contains three beginner-friendly Data Science and Machine Learning projects completed as part of the Codsoft Internship. Each project demonstrates essential steps in a data science workflow  including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, evaluation, and visualization using Python.

 Projects Included
1. Titanic Survival Prediction
Objective: Predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on features like age, class, sex, and fare.

Techniques Used: Logistic Regression, Data Cleaning, Handling Missing Values

Libraries: pandas, seaborn, sklearn, matplotlib

Outcome: Built a classification model using logistic regression and interpreted survival trends across demographics.

2.  Sales Prediction
Objective: Forecast future sales based on historical transactional data.

Techniques Used: Data Visualization, Feature Engineering, Regression Modeling

Libraries: pandas, numpy, seaborn, sklearn

Outcome: Predicted sales using linear regression, visualized trends by category and region, and evaluated model performance.

3.  Iris Flower Classification
Objective: Classify iris flowers into three species based on petal and sepal dimensions.

Techniques Used: Logistic Regression, Data Visualization

Libraries: sklearn.datasets, matplotlib, seaborn, pandas

Outcome: Trained a logistic regression classifier and visualized decision boundaries.

 Tools & Technologies
Python (Google Colab)

NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn (for machine learning models)
